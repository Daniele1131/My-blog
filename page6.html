			<h3> Montreal Football Club great season debut </h3>
			<p>
				Today, the Montreal Impact kick-started their 2021 season with a very reassuring 4-2 win over their 
				fierce rivals Toronto FC. Montreal played a very composed and fast-paced game and took advantage 
				of the many scoring opportunities they had. This performance is a great bounce back from the poor 
				2020 campaign they had last year. It is safe to say that the administration has done an excellent 
				job of acquiring excellent players over the span of this off-season. If this is an indicator of how 
				they will be playing this year, we are most certainly in for a treat!
