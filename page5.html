			<h3> MLS season in full effect </h3>
			<p>
				Today marqued the begining of the 21st Major League Soccer season and this glorious day did not fail to disapoint. 
				Two games were played today, with the Houston Dynamo beating the San Jose Earthquake 2-1 in very well faught game, 
				filled with action and plenty of shots on goal. The second game played today was the Seattle Sounders completely 
				destroying Minnesota United FC 4-0 in a dominating fashion. If the rest of the season is to played with as much action
				and grit as these too games, we are all in for a treat.
