			<h3> The creation of a Europeen Super League threatning to ruin soccer's future </h3>
			<p>
				On April 18th, 2021, the creation of a new European "Super League" was announced. The idea was for the top European
				football clubs to break away from UEFA and start their own competition in 2021. Twelve different teams from three different
				leagues decided to join this new league. Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City, Barcelona,
				Real Madrid, Athletico Madrid,  Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan were the twelve teams who accepted the invitation to this new
				competition.  These clubs would be offered 400 million â‚¬ if they accepted the invitation to the league. The format of the 
				competition would favour some of the strongest, biggest clubs in European football. Meaning that all these giant clubs would 
				increase their profits and make unimaginable money while the other smaller clubs would just end up losing money and being forgotten.
				As we expected, the reaction of the fans was extremely negative, sparking many protests and negative reactions on social media. 
				There immerged the slogan "created by the poor, stolen by the rich". With all the fans against this radical idea, it is up to the 
				owners to realize that their love for the beautiful sport of soccer is worth more than money.
